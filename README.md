The main.py file contains the model architecture of the network described in the paper --{Insert ref here}--. To see the model summary, including weights, layer arguements and activation functions, utilize the 
```python
model.summary()
```
function after compiling. You can also generate a diagram of the network through the

```python
keras.utils.vis_utils.plot_model(args)
```
function.
